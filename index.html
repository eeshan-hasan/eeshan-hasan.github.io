                                <p class="lead mb-5">I am a dual PhD Cognitive Science and Psychology student, advised by <a href='https://computationaldecisionlab.com/'>Jennifer Trueblood </a> at Indiana University. <br> <br> I combine computational and experimental methods to study cognitive decision-making, focusing on the interplay between perception, attention, and memory. My research explores the interaction between human and machine cognition, aiming to use insights from human cognition (e.g., wisdom of the crowds) to enhance AI training. Conversely, I investigate how machines can help us better understand and improve human decision- making processes. <br><br>

                                I have a background in psychology, mathematics and machine learning. Previously, I finished my Masters in Psychology at Vanderbilt University and Masters in Mathematics from the University of Hyderabad, India. I worked for a year in a healthcare analytics startup as a Mathematician/Machine Learning Specialist.<br> <br>

                                While my interests are broad, most of my work is in medical decision making. I have also studied decisions ranging from multi-attribute choice, consumer decisions and social media decisions. In my research I have use statistical methods, approximate Bayesian inference, evidence accumulation models and machine learning (deep learning) models. Some of my broad approaches are.

                                    <li> <b> How do we use collective human intelligence to train machines? </b> <br>Humans are noisy, potentially biased and disagree with each other (some times themselves). How do we then leverage collective intelligence using wisdom of the crowds to train machines? Doing this incorrectly might perpetuate bias. <br> <b>What we find:</b>  If you put enough novices together, they can classify white blood cell images <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/tops.12588"> better than experts </a>. When you put the same number of experts,they are much better than novices. When you <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-024-00558-6">crowdsource people from an app</a> from all over the world and select the best people to annotate skin lesion medical data, you fail to get a sense of the uncertainty and might miss out on the rarer classes. Do not only select the best!
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <b> How do we use machine intelligence to understand and improve humans? </b>  <br>You can look inside the minds of machines since we have created them. How do we leverage this to better understand human intelligence and find ways of supporting humans? <br> <b>What we find:</b> You can use the representations from these machines to <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4p6878mm"> find and fix inconsistencies </a> in human (novice) decisions. We also find that novice without any training might represent complex medical stimuli in similar ways as expert machines, highlighting the adaptiveness of human representations.
                                    <li> <b>How do cognitive processes interact with decision making?</b> <br>We often study cognitive science separately in perception, memory, attention and decision making. However, these processes interact with each other in interesting ways. <br> <b> What we find: </b> In a choice display with three items (ABC),  <a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/rfcgp">  the presentation order (eg. BAC, CBA, ACB) impacts decisions </a> potentially because one might pay more attention to the differences and compare neighboring options. However, manipulating attention processes by <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5jq8n5w9">making alternatives salient impacts choice </a> by creating a salience selection bias for the intuitive thinkers but does not change comparisons. 
                                     <li> <b>How do we Scale Science and Modeling</b> In traditional settings, we developed approaches to test a handful of models, using a handful of individuals in a handful of conditions. Now we have the power to scale this by several orders of magnitudes. What is the best way of doing this? <br> <b>Our efforts: </b> Using an exploratory registered report, we recruited more than 2000 individuals and assigned them to one in 24 conditions to conduct a  <a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/rfcgp">  large experiment in multi-attribute choice </a>. In another project, we used a switchboard analysis to test hundreds of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-024-00558-6">wisdom of the crowd models</a>.

                                <p class="card-text">Artificial neural networks can give us representations of complex real-world images, expanding the scope of cognitive computational modeling beyond boring lab stimuli that have simple representations. My research uses these representations to better understand and augment human decision-making. We demonstrate how medical-image classification decisions can be de-noised by aggregating decisions on similar images. In our algorithm, the final decision on a target image is cancerous if a percentage t of the k most similar images are cancerous, else it is not cancerous. Similarity between images is calculated as the distance between representations from an artificial neural network. We show that this algorithm works for novices but not experts, indicating difference in decision making processes for the two populations (Hasan et al. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/tops.12588"> 2022a </a> , <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4p6878mm"> 2022b </a>).  More recently, I find that novice representations are more like domain-specific CNNs trained on cancer cell classification showing that human representations are flexible and can meaningfully extract information from domain-specific stimuli.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">I am curious about how bounded resources such as visual attention might impact choice. To study the impact of presentation format on choice, we designed a registered report with a large-scale experiment with over 2000 individuals 24 different condition, comprehensively manipulating the presentation format. We find that the order robustly impacts choice for the attraction effect by potentially changing the comparisons that are made <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/rfcgp/"> (Hasan et al. 2024) </a> . Using a mechanistic process model to compare mechanisms, we find that bottom-up attention by making options salient impact choice in different ways by creating a selection boost <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5jq8n5w9">(Hasan et al. 2024) </a>. This highlights the complexity in the role of attention in choice. </p>

                                <p class="card-text">According to the wisdom of the crowd phenomenon, the aggregated decision of a group is more accurate than the decision of an average decision-maker. In medical decision making, we find the wisdom of the inner crowd effect, where repeated decisions improves individual classification accuracy for both novices and experts. Building on these results, we show that aggregation algorithms based on confidence weighting scale to larger groups of participants, dramatically improving diagnostic accuracy, with the performance of groups of novices reaching that of individual experts <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/dec0000210">Hasan et al. (2023)</a>. We collaborate with <a href="https://www.centaurlabs.com/">Centaur Labs</a>, which recruits individuals with varying expertise to label medical datasets on an app-based interface. There was a large dispersion in the geographical location, experience, training, and performance of the recruited individuals. We tested several wisdom of the crowd algorithms of varying complexity from a simple unweighted average to more complex Bayesian models that account for individual patterns of errors. Using a switchboard analysis, we observe that the best-performing algorithms rely on selecting top performers, weighting decisions by training accuracy, and take into account the task environment. These algorithms far exceed expert performance. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-024-00558-6"> Hasan et al. (2024)</a></p>

It has created an environment with complex interactions between human, algorithms and other entities. How does this affect cognition and behavior? In one paper, we focus on <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-recognize-and-tame-your-cognitive-distortions-202205042738#:~:text=Cognitive%20distortions%20are%20internal%20mental,cut%20down%20our%20mental%20burden." target="_blank">cognitive distortions</a> or distorted thinking is the use of exaggerated unrealistic ways of thinking and speaking which is associated with mental illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia. Social media, parallelly, has a heightened use of language associated with cognitive distortions. My research examines this association between mental illness and social media use in a controlled experimental environment. We investigated the impact of teaching individuals about cognitive distortions and studied the change in decisions to interact with online social media content. <a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/47cqw">Hasan et al.

                                    <p class="card-text">The internal layers of a neural network contain important information about the stimulus. I am interested in exploiting this geometric structure and explore the correspondence between humans and machines. Recently, I built myself a deep learning PC to explore this further. I am comfortable especially with PyTorch and have trained convolutional neural networks, transformers, GANs etc,. </p>

                                    <p class="card-text">In evidence accumulation models, evidence is continuously accumulated until a threshold of evidence is accumulated after which a decision is triggered. Within this framework, one might make different models to explain what the nature of this evidence is, how it is accumulated and when a decision is triggered. This has allowed us to explore all sorts of decision biases and the role of attention in decision making. I typically use python and custom code for this sort of analysis.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Bayesian models give us the uncertainty in our estimates. I have used PyMC3 for most of my Bayesian Analysis. I have also coded up my own differential evolution MC sampler. I loved looking under the hood to see how these sampling algorithms work and the kind of issues they may have. My experience also made me realize concerns about issues such as inference with correlated parameters, bimodal distributions etc. which are issues with inference in general (not just Bayesian inference).</p>
